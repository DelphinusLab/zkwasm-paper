\section{Customized Instruction Extension}
\label{chp:foreign}
Just like architecture specific instructions in normal hardware, \zkwasm\, supports customizing foreign instruction extension as well. More specificly, \zkwasm\, provides two ways to extend the instructions set, one way is implementing customized inline opcodes and the other way is batching external proofs of pure functions.

Given a fixed image, an entry function and an array of input arguments, the execution trace is fixed which means the number of instructions are fixed. As we described in Section \ref{chp:ex-table}, each instruction occupies $n$ (a fixed number of) rows in the execution circuit $T_\mathcal{E}$. Thus the total rows of $T_\mathcal{E}$ is fixed. When doing proof in Halo2 using KZG commitment, each column is interpolated into polynomials using FFT (fast fourier transform). Because FFT is an algorithm of $NlogN$ complexity, the total rows of $T_\mathcal{E}$ affacts the overall performance in a nonlinear way. Thus to reduce the number of columns, a good way is to batch multiple instructions into one.

When the semantic of instructions we would like to batch is simple and can fit into one instruction block, we can use the inline extension. For example, suppose that we want to sum the lowest 4 bits $x:u64$ by function $sumLowest(x)$. If we use a standard loop to implement the algorithm, it will takes $4$ instructions to extract $4$ bits and takes another $2$ to do the sum. However, if we inline this function in to a foreign function, then we can encode the arithmetic constraint within one instruction block. As a case study, we compare the SHA256 execution trace with and without inline the following macro:
