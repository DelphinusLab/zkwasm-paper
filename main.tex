%% article.
\begin{abstract}
  zk-SNARK (zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge) is a powerful proof system that allows efficient verification of the evaluation problem of polynomials. To further extending this technology to verify the evaluation of computer programs, we present ZKWASM, a ZKSNARK backed virtual machine that emulates the execution of web assembly bytecode and generates zero-knowledge-proofs for the emulation result. The proof generated by the \zkwasm virtual machine can then be used to convince an entity, with no leakage of confidential information, that the result of the emulation enforces the semantic specification of web assembly
